# Q-LAB-2D:  Gridworld AI Simulator

**A high-performance, zero-dependency visualization of Reinforcement Learning running entirely in your browser.**

Watch an AI agent learn to navigate complex mazes using the Q-Learning algorithm. Build the world, tweak the hyperparameters on the fly, and hit **Turbo Mode** to train thousands of episodes in seconds.

### Key Features

  * **Real-time Tuning:** Adjust learning rates, exploration (epsilon), and gamma instantly via sliders. Watch the math update live.
  * **Turbocharged:** Push speed past 85% to disengage the renderer and train the agent at maximum computational speed.
  * **Map Editor:** Draw your own environments. Add walls, slow-down mud, slippery ice, and **teleporting portals**.
  * **Visual Feedback:** Analyze performance with Policy Arrows, Heatmaps, and a live glowing "Best Path" overlay.
